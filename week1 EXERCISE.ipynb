      "\n",
      "This code defines a function called `mystery` that takes a list of numbers (`nums`) as input and reverses the order of the elements in that list. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initialization of Pointers**:\n",
      "   - Two pointers, `left` and `right`, are initialized. `left` starts at the beginning of the list (index 0), while `right` starts at the end of the list (index `len(nums) - 1`).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **While Loop**:\n",
      "   - The loop `while left < right:` continues executing as long as the `left` pointer is less than the `right` pointer. This condition ensures that elements are swapped until they potentially meet in the middle.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Swapping Elements**:\n",
      "   - Inside the loop, the elements at the `left` and `right` indices are swapped using the assignment: `nums[left], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[left]`. This effectively exchanges the values of the two positions in the list.\n",
      "   \n",
      "4. **Moving the Pointers**:\n",
      "   - After swapping, the `left` pointer is incremented by 1 (`left += 1`), and the `right` pointer is decremented by 1 (`right -= 1`). This moves both pointers closer to the center of the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Completion and Return**:\n",
      "   - Once the `left` pointer is no longer less than the `right` pointer, the loop exits, and the function returns the modified list, which is now reversed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example\n",
      "If you call the function with:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "result = mystery([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
      "```\n",
      "The steps would be:\n",
      "- Initial list: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n",
      "- 1st swap (`left=0`, `right=4`): `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`\n",
      "- 2nd swap (`left=1`, `right=3`): `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`\n",
      "- The loop stops when `left` is no longer less than `right`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "In essence, this function effectively reverses the input list in place (meaning it modifies the original list rather than creating a new one) and returns the reversed list.\n",

      "**Code Explanation: In-Place Swap of a Sorted Array**\n",
      "\n",
      "This code implements an in-place sorting algorithm called \"in-place bubble sort\" or \"in-place swap sort\". It's a simple, yet inefficient sorting technique.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Code Breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def mystery(nums):\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "The function takes a single argument `nums`, which is expected to be a list of numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Two pointers, `left` and `right`, are initialized to the beginning and end of the array, respectively. These pointers will be used to swap adjacent elements in the array.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "while left < right:\n",
      "    nums[left], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[left]\n",
      "    left += 1\n",
      "    right -= 1\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "The algorithm enters a loop that continues until `left` is no longer less than `right`. In each iteration, the code swaps the elements at indices `left` and `right`, then increments `left` and decrements `right`.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why does this work?**\n",
      "\n",
      "At first glance, it may seem counterintuitive to swap adjacent elements in a decreasing manner. However, here's the key insight:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Initially, the largest element is at index 0 (left) and the smallest element is at index -1 (right).\n",
      "2. In each iteration, we swap the leftmost element with the rightmost element.\n",
      "3. After swapping, the leftmost element becomes smaller than the next one to its right (at index `left` + 1), so it \"moves\" to a position where it can be compared with elements that are larger than itself.\n",
      "4. The process repeats until all elements have been swapped and sorted.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Walkthrough:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose we have an array `[5, 2, 8, 3]`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Initially:\n",
      "- `left` = 0\n",
      "- `right` = 3\n",
      "\n",
      "First iteration:\n",
      "- Swap elements at indices 0 and 3: `[2, 5, 8, 3]`\n",
      "- Update pointers: `left` = 1, `right` = 2\n",
      "\n",
      "Second iteration:\n",
      "- Swap elements at indices 1 and 2: `[2, 3, 5, 8]`\n",
      "- Update pointers: `left` = 2, `right` = 1\n",
      "\n",
      "Third iteration:\n",
      "- Swap elements at indices 2 and 1: `[2, 3, 8, 5]`\n",
      "- Update pointers: `left` = 3, `right` = 0\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth iteration:\n",
      "- Swap elements at indices 3 and 0: `[2, 3, 5, 8]`\n",
      "- Update pointers: `left` = 4 (out of bounds!), so the loop ends.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Final Result:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The sorted array is `[2, 3, 5, 8]`.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, this code demonstrates a simple in-place sorting algorithm using swap operations. While not efficient for large arrays, it can be useful for educational purposes or when memory is limited.\n",
